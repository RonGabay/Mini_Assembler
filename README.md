# Project_In_C
A C-language project was performed in Linux and done with a study partner.
The project simulates operations in machine language (assembly) and translates them from binary code to hexa-decimal in the final stage.
The project at the beginning behind me works in several stages:
First stage: I defined rules and stopping conditions so that the different types of registers can be entered in the terminal and worked with as in assembler.
Second stage: I defined identification of the registers and what they do, and then, the system recognizes and accordingly converts the command lines into binary code.
Third stage: I defined that the system will translate the binary code received from the system and then convert it to hexadecimal code.
Fourth stage:  output to the screen/user what was received from the background work.
