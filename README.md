# Project-In-C: Machine Language Simulator
This project, written in C for Linux, simulates basic machine language operations and translates instructions from binary to hexadecimal code. It was developed collaboratively with a study partner.

# Functionality:
The project operates in four main stages:
* Register Definition and Input:
Establishes rules and stopping conditions for user interaction with various register types through the terminal.
This emulates register manipulation commonly found in assembly language.
* Register Identification and Instruction Conversion:
Defines the functionalities of each register type.
Implements logic to identify user-provided commands and convert them into their corresponding binary code representation.
* Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion:
Translates the generated binary code into hexadecimal format.
* Output Display:
Presents the final hexadecimal code to the user, reflecting the processed instructions.

# Collaboration:
This project was developed in collaboration with a study partner.

# Further Development:
This is a foundational project and can be extended to incorporate additional functionalities such as:
* Simulating more complex machine language instructions.
* Supporting a wider range of register types.
* Implementing error handling for invalid user input.
